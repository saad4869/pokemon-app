# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You're right, I went beyond the specified scope in my summary. Let me correct that by focusing only on the implementation up to the extraction of the modal component (Commit 6).

# Pokémon Explorer: Technical Implementation Summary 

## API Consumption Strategy

- **Service Layer Separation**: Implemented dedicated API functions in `src/api/pokemonApi.ts` to isolate API logic from components
- **Pagination Implementation**: Used offset/limit parameters to efficiently fetch data in manageable batches
- **Error Handling**: Implemented try/catch blocks for API calls with appropriate error states
- **Type-Safe Responses**: Created TypeScript interfaces to match API response structures

## Loading States and Initial API Calls

- **Visibility Management**: Added loading indicators during initial data fetching
- **State Tracking**: Used local state `loading` boolean to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Component-Level State**: Managed loading states within the PokemonList component
- **Initial Data Loading**: Implemented useEffect hook for first data fetch on component mount

## UI Component Logic Distribution

- **API Logic**: Kept API calls in the PokemonList component but isolated in specific functions
- **Transformation Logic**: Created utility function for extracting IDs from URLs
- **Component Structure**: Separated list into container (PokemonList) and item (PokemonCard) components
- **Event Handling**: Passed click handlers from container to card components

## Infinite Scrolling Implementation

- **Scroll Detection**: Added event listeners to detect when user approaches bottom of page
- **Conditional Loading**: Only triggers new API calls when not already loading and more data exists
- **URL-Based Pagination**: Used the `next` URL from API responses to maintain pagination state
- **Buffer Distance**: Initiated loading before reaching absolute bottom for seamless experience

## UI/UX Design

- **Responsive Grid**: Implemented CSS Grid with auto-fill and minmax for adaptive layouts
- **Card Design**: Applied clean styling with hover effects for visual feedback
- **Modal Design**: Created overlay and content container for Pokémon details
- **Interactive Elements**: Added close button and click-outside behavior for modal dismissal

## Modal Component Extraction

- **Component Separation**: Moved modal code from PokemonList into dedicated PokemonModal component
- **Props Interface**: Created clear interface for modal props (pokemon data and close handler)
- **Conditional Rendering**: Added null return when no Pokémon is selected
- **Event Management**: Maintained click handlers for modal interaction
- **Clean Refactoring**: Updated PokemonList to use the new modal component

## Code Organization

- **File Structure**: Organized into API, components, types, and utilities
- **Component Hierarchy**: Established parent-child relationships with proper prop passing
- **CSS Organization**: Created component-specific and shared styling classes
- **State Management**: Using React's useState and useEffect for local state management

This implementation provides a functional application with Pokémon listing, infinite scrolling, and detail viewing capabilities, all without Redux integration at this stage of development.
